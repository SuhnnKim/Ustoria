<p>
Finding the shortest path between two locations can play an important
part in a video game.  This article will explore two well-known algorithms
to find the shortest path.  The article includes a working demo you can
use to explore how each of the algorithms works in detail.
<p>
The demo shows a map of cities connected by roads in black.  The straight
line distance between cities not connected by roads is shown in gray.  The
problem is to find the shortest distance between any two cities.  The
simple solution to this problem is to follow every road until you reach
the destination and then pick the shortest route.  The problem is that
in a big map with many cities, this soon takes a long time to calculate.
What is needed is a way to calculate a good solution without having to follow
every road to the destination.
<p>
The solution is to use a <em>heuristic</em> which does a low-cost estimate
of whether you are on a good road to the destination or not.  The demo uses
the greedy algorithm and the A* algorithm, which differ only in the heuristic
used.
<p>
Try the demo and then read on to see how the algorithms work.

<h2>The Greedy Algorithm</h2>
The Greedy algorithm picks the next city it should go to by selecting the
city that is closest to the final destination.  The map shows several cities
connected by roads, shown as black lines.  The distances between the cities
are shown beside the roads.  The map also shows the distances between cities
not connected by roads in light gray.  These are just distances and cannot
be used to travel between cities.

<p>
Consider going from London to Peterborough:
<ul>
<li> Kitchener is 200 Km from Peterborough while Hamilton is only 175 Km,
so the algorith selects Hamilton as the next city.</l1>
<li> Working out from Hamilton, we find Kitchener is 200 Km from Peterborough, Toronto is
139 Km, and St. Catherines is 147 Km.  As a result, it goes to Toronto next.</l1>
<li> From Toronto it can go to Barrie at 160 Km from Peterborough or it can
go to Peterborough at 0 Km from Peterborough.  It goes to Peterborough and
is finished.
</ul>

<h2>The A* Algorithm</H2>
The A* algorithm modifies the greedy algorithm to take into account not just
the distance from the next city to the final destination, but also the
distance from the current city to the next city.

<p>
Consider going from London to Peterborough using the A* algorithm:
<ul>
<li> Kitchener is 200 Km from Peterborough plus 100 Km from London for
a total of 300.  while Hamilton is 175 Km, from Peterborough plus 125 from
London, also yielding 300 Km.  The algorithm arbitrarily selects Kitchener.
as the next city.</l1>
<li> Working out from Kitchener, we find the Hamilton route to be 235 Km
while the Barrie route is 340 Km.  Thus, it goes to Hamilton next.</l1>
<li> From Hamilton it can go to Barrie at 305 Km, Toronto at 209, or
St. Catherines at 197.  The algorithm selects St. Catherines.  As humans,
we can see it has made a bad choice because there is no road from St. Catherines
to Toronto and it has reached a dead end.  The algorithm does not know this until
it goes to St. Catherines and finds there are no roads forward.</li>
<li> Since it cannot move forward, it goes back to Hamilton and tries the next
best route.  THis time it selects Toronto as the best option and goes there.</li>
<li> From Toronto, the Barrie route is 250 Km while the Peterborough route
is 139.  It takes the Peterborough route and is finished.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comparison of Algorithms</H2>
In most cases the A* algorithm produces better results than the greedy
algorithm.  In the example above, A* did not find the best solution
because it had a tie between cities and picked the wrong one.
<p>
The difference between the algorithms is how it judges how close a city is
to its final destination.  This measure of closeness is called a <em>
heuristic</em>.  As we see here, changing the heuristic can change the
path selected by the algorithm.
<h2>The Demo</h2>
Try various combinations of cities and algorthms in the demo.  It will show
paths it considered in yellow and paths it selected in red.  You will find
different results for the two algorithms.  You will find that A* is better
in most of the cases you try.
<p>
Since the algorithm can reach a dead-end and get stuck, it must be able to
backtrack and look for an alternate route.  This is most easily implemented
using recursion so that the run-time stack will maintain the path back.
You also need access to the path you have followed so that you do not
go back to the city you just came from.
